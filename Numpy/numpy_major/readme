NumPy Mathematical Calculator 🧮

A Python-based interactive calculator using NumPy to perform mathematical, statistical, and array manipulation operations efficiently. This project demonstrates practical usage of NumPy arrays for computations and data analysis.

🎯 Project Overview

This interactive console application allows users to:

Perform basic arithmetic operations on arrays.

Conduct statistical analysis such as mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, max, sum, and product.

Manipulate arrays by reshaping, sorting, finding unique elements, and filtering values.

The calculator leverages NumPy, providing fast and efficient array computations.
